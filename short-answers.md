# Short Answer Questions
For the following five questions, type out your answers in 1-2 paragraphs (no coding required):

1. How is a global variable different from a local variable in JavaScript?
Answer: The difference between a global variable and a local variable is that a global is non-local, it has a larger scope when creating a function. Creating a global scope can lead to difficulty due to namespace pollution, the possibility of creating variables that may reference other variables is a big thing when coding because many words could be similar and if you incorrectly spell a variable incorrectly, debugging will need to occur.

2. What is closure?
Answer: A closure is self-invoking function. When a function begins the other function remembers its "environment" is is able to return a solution. 

3. What is scope? When is new scope created in JavaScript?
Answer: Scope is a set of functions, variables and parameters that are used to create. There are two scopes, local and global scopes. A new scope is created when a function is created. A local scope is created within that function, not global.

4. What is a callback? Provide an example of when you can use one in JavaScript
Answer: A callback function is a function within another function. When two functions are being rendered, the second function will always complete prior to the first function and with that completion, the second function will be solvable. An example of a call back is a local variable, a declared variable and a call.

5. What happens when you type a URL into a browser and hit enter?
Answer: When a url is typed, the url is sent to the DNS (Domain Name Service) where it sends an IP address back to the browser. The browser builds an http request and send through the router, which passed through an internet provider to a tier network. The network sends back an http response back to the browser and now have access the url you typed.
